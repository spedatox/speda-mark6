"""The `task` tool — hand a job to a subagent and get back only the answer.

The cost this exists to avoid is context, not time. Finding one function in an
unfamiliar repo can take twenty file reads, and the parent then carries those
twenty files for the rest of the session, paying for them on every subsequent
turn. Delegating the search costs it one paragraph.

See forge/warden/subagents.py for the boundaries (depth one, allowlist-as-reach).

    A subagent is already bounded, and bounded better than a wall clock can do

    handover. Cancelling it at an arbitrary second throws all of that away —
    every file it read, every conclusion it reached, and specifically the
    handover, which is the one artefact that would have made the lost work
    resumable. A slow subagent is the case where the backstop's cure is
    reliably worse than the disease.

    It is not unbounded, and this is not an exemption from being stoppable: the
    operator's interrupt propagates into the child through the shared signal,
