"""What is broken right now, without running the whole suite.

This is the half of a language server that a coding agent actually needs. The
other half — where is this defined, who calls this, what is coupled to what —
is already answered by the graph tools, and answered across languages at once,
which no single language server does.

What the graph cannot tell you is whether the code you just wrote is valid. Two
NameErrors shipped in this repo in a single afternoon (`Transition` and
`require_reader`, both used before being imported) and both were caught by the
test suite, minutes later, as a red run whose traceback had to be read back to
its cause. A linter finds that class of fault in under a second, before anything
is executed, and points straight at the line.

Deliberately NOT a language server. Spawning one per language and speaking
JSON-RPC over document-sync buys go-to-definition and rename on top of this, and
costs a process lifecycle, an editor state machine, and a per-language install.
Running the project's own checker gets the diagnostics — the part that changes
whether the agent notices it broke something — for a subprocess call.
