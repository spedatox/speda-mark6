"""The `claude_code` tool — delegate to the real Claude Code CLI.

This bridges Forge's subagent system to the Claude Code CLI, routed through
the free-claude-code proxy so it uses the same provider keys the rest of the
system does. It spawns `fcc-claude` inside the Cell, where it has the same
workspace and toolchain as any other command, and streams its activity through
the subagent emit channel so Heartbreaker shows the delegation live.

Streaming note: the Cell contract (`Cell.run`) returns complete output, not a
line-by-line stream. Until that contract grows a streaming method, the subagent
panel shows "started" → "Working…" → "finished" rather than per-tool-call
granularity. The operator still sees that a delegation is in flight, how long
it took, and the full report — the same visibility every other subagent gets.
