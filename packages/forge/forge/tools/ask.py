"""`ask_operator` — putting a question to the person, mid-job.

The gate already lets the agent ask for *permission*. This is the other half:
asking for a **decision or an opinion** when the work has reached a fork the
agent should not pick unilaterally. Prototyping on a server is exactly where
that bites — nobody is watching, the agent hits "REST or WebSocket?", and its
choices today are guess silently or stop.

**Not permission, and the difference is the failure direction.** An unanswered
permission request is a no, because absence of an operator must never become
consent. An unanswered question is *not* a no — there is nothing to refuse, and
blocking the work because nobody was around to have an opinion turns a courtesy
into a deadlock. So this degrades to "decide it yourself and say that you did",
which `oracle.Reply.guidance` spells out.

**Rationed by description, not by code.** An agent that asks about everything is
worse than one that asks about nothing: the first trains the owner to stop
reading, and then the one question that mattered goes unread too. There is no
counter enforcing that — a limit would fire on the wrong question as often as
the right one — so the description carries the whole of it.
