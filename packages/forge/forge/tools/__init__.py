"""The Forge's curated tool set.

A small, fixed toolset, so every schema is sent on turn 1 — no deferred-loading /
ToolSearch machinery (study §2 open question 5: only needed when the tool list
strains the prompt, which a curated set does not). Each tool declares its own
harness-side safety flags; the loop and permission engine read those, the model
never sees them.

# Navigation — how an agent orients in a repo it did not write. Shared by every
# profile: the alternative is reading whole files, which fills the window before
# the work starts.
NAV_TOOLS = [ReadFile, Grep, Glob]

# Research — what the repo cannot answer. Kept as its own group so a profile can
# take navigation without taking the open internet; see web.py on why this is
# independent of the Cell's allow_network posture.
WEB_TOOLS = [WebSearch, WebFetch]

# The vault. Its own group because it is the owner's filesystem rather than a
# capability of the repo: a profile can take coding tools without being handed a
# door into the owner's documents. Withheld at dispatch when no machine token is
# configured (see toolsource.without_hisar_tools), so an agent whose profile
# allows them still never sees a door it has no key to.
HISAR_TOOLS = [HisarList, HisarRead, HisarDeposit]

# Reaching the owner mid-job. Its own group for the same reason the vault is:
# messaging a person is not a capability of working on a repo, and a profile
# should be able to take coding tools without one. Withheld at dispatch when
# no bot is configured.
NOTIFY_TOOLS = [TelegramSend]

# Publishing to GitHub, with the push credential held Warden-side. Its own group,
# separate from `coding`, for the same reason the vault is: pushing (and opening
# a PR, which reuses the same credential) under a real account's token is a
# capability a profile takes on purpose, not something every repo-working agent
# inherits. Withheld at dispatch when no token is configured
# (toolsource.without_git_tools), so a deployment with no credential never offers
# a door it has no key for. Committing needs none of this — it happens in the
# Cell with the identity env; only the two calls that reach GitHub are gated.
GIT_TOOLS = [GitPush, OpenPR]

# Asking the owner a question mid-job. In CODING_TOOLS rather than its own
# group: reaching a fork you should not pick alone is not an optional extra
# for real work, it is the alternative to guessing silently. Degrades on its
# own when no operator is reachable, so it needs no dispatch-time gate.
ASK_TOOLS = [AskOperator]

# The owner's memory, which lives in Mark VI. Its own group because it is the
# owner's, not the repository's — the same line the vault is on — and because a
# profile should be able to take coding tools without being handed the power to
# rewrite what every other agent believes about him. Withheld at dispatch when
# there is no channel to Mark VI, so the standalone TUI never sees it.
MEMORY_TOOLS = [Memory]

# Reaching back through Mark VI for what was SAID (recall over past sessions) and
# what the OTHER agents have been doing (the shared network channel). Its own
# group, separate from MEMORY_TOOLS, because it is read-only knowledge retrieval
# rather than the power to write the owner's memory — a profile can recall past
# conversations and see its peers' work without also being able to rewrite a
# fact every other agent trusts. Both reach Mark VI over the same peer socket the
# `memory` tool uses, so the group is withheld under the same condition: no
# channel, no tools (toolsource.without_recall_tools). This is also the seam that
# makes the two Forge peers aware of each other's activity — see forge/tools/recall.py.
RECALL_TOOLS = [RecallConversations, ReadAgentChannel]

# remember_about_owner is deliberately NOT in MEMORY_TOOLS: that group is
# stripped whenever there is no channel to Mark VI (toolsource.without_memory_tools),
# and offline is exactly the case this tool exists for — it queues locally and
# needs no channel at all. Listed individually in ALL_TOOLS instead, so a
# profile takes it by name rather than inheriting it through a group built
# around the opposite assumption.

# Reusable tool groups, referenced by agent configs via their allowlist (§2).
# todo_write is in the coding group rather than its own: a plan is not an
# optional capability for multi-step work, it is what keeps it coherent.
# `task` is here rather than in a group of its own: delegating is not an
# optional extra for real work, it is how a long job avoids drowning its own
# context. A profile that omits it simply never spawns subagents.
