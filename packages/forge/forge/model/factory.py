"""Model factory — turns a ``provider:model`` ref into a Warden `Model`.

`build_model` is the single place model selection happens. Anthropic refs get the
native SDK client; every other provider gets the shared OpenAI-compatible adapter.

An optional fallback chain (FORGE_LLM_FALLBACK_CHAIN) mirrors Mark VI: refs tried
in order when *opening* a stream fails (auth / rate-limit / connection / 5xx).
It is OFF by default. The Forge's baseline discipline is 'one model, fail loud';
this is the one operator-configured, opt-in concession — provider redundancy for a
single operator who runs several providers, not an automatic per-turn escalation
ladder. Once tokens are flowing a turn is never restarted on another provider.
