"""AnthropicModel — the real Warden reasoning client.

Streams text deltas during a turn and surfaces tool-use blocks once the turn
resolves. Honors the interrupt signal by stopping the stream promptly. There is
deliberately no model-fallback ladder and no token-escalation recovery (§3
rejected list): one model, fail loud.

Prompt caching is applied here and nowhere else. The Warden's shape makes it
mandatory rather than an optimisation: one job runs up to `max_iterations`
laps, every lap re-sends the entire system prompt, the entire tool array and
the entire transcript so far, and the ledger does not even consider compacting
until the prompt approaches 170 K tokens. Uncached, that is the same six-figure
prefix billed at full rate thirty times over. The engine already avoids
rebuilding the tool array when nothing changed, precisely so this cache holds
(see `_refresh_tools`) — this module is the half that was missing.
