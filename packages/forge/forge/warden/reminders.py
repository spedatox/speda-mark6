"""Nudges the loop injects into itself, when the state earns one.

The system prompt is read once and then competes with everything that has
happened since. A reminder arrives at the moment it applies, attached to the
tool results that made it true, which is why it lands when the prompt did not.

The mechanism is trivial — a `<system-reminder>` block appended to the user
message carrying the tool results. Everything worth arguing about is the
CONDITIONS. Each rule here corresponds to a failure that actually happened in
this repository, not to a principle someone thought sounded good:

- an agent called the same tool with the same arguments three times running,
  because the error told it to pass an argument the tool did not expose
- an agent wrote a tool, ran it, got a number that was wrong by an order of
  magnitude, and wrote a paragraph explaining the number instead of checking it
- an agent edited files across a long job and never ran anything
- an agent ran a formatter, then edited a file against the version it had read
  before the formatter touched it (see `file_changed_notice`, which is a
  statement of fact rather than a rule, and so is exempt from the first
  constraint below)

Three constraints keep them from becoming wallpaper, which is the only way a
reminder system fails:

**Once each, per job.** A rule that fires repeatedly teaches the reader to skip
the block, and then the one that mattered is skipped too.

**Never when the thing is already happening.** A "you have not run the tests"
that fires while the tests are running is worse than silence, because it says
the harness is not watching.

**Specific enough to act on.** "Remember to verify" is furniture. "You have
called grep with these exact arguments twice and both failed" is a next step.

# main". The memory-protocol fragment tells the agent to write one down; this is
# the backstop for the turn it does not, and it can only be a backstop if it can
# recognise the shape of such an instruction in the owner's own words.
#
# Precision over recall, deliberately. A false positive nags the agent to file
# something that was not a rule — the wallpaper failure a reminder system dies
# of — so the signals stay to phrasings that are hard to read any other way than
# "this is how I want it done from here on". A rule this misses is still caught
