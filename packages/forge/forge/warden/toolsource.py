"""Seam 1 — where a job's tools come from.

`ALL_TOOLS` is a dict in a package, so a tool that lives anywhere else — an MCP
server's, a plugin's — has nowhere to stand. This is the standing-place: an
ordered list of providers, folded at job assembly.

**Collisions are loud.** A later provider may not shadow an earlier provider's
name. Silent override is how a plugin quietly replaces `write_file` with its own
and nobody finds out until something is deleted; the alternative to a startup
error is a security incident.

**Providers are re-callable.** `provide` is asked again between turns, not only
once at assembly, because an MCP server that finishes connecting mid-job would
otherwise be unusable until the next job. The fold is cheap and idempotent for
the builtin provider, so re-asking costs nothing when nothing changed.
