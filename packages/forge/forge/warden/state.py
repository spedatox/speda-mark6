"""Loop state and the single typed exit (§3).

All cross-iteration state lives in one mutable LoopState; the loop returns exactly
one Terminal with an enumerated reason. No loop state is scattered across
free-standing variables, and there is no second 'are we done' signal.

The loop is a state machine, and both of its edges are named. `StopReason` closes
the set of ways it can end; `ContinueReason` closes the set of ways it can go
round again. The second half matters as much as the first: a loop whose only
recovery vocabulary is 'it continued' cannot report what it recovered from, and
cannot be tested for having recovered at all. Every `continue` site in the engine
stamps a reason, and the stamps accumulate — so the journal, the post-mortem, and
the test all read the same names."""
