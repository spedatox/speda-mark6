"""run_job — the single assembly point behind every Gate front door.

Given a validated JobRequest and an agent config, it builds a FRESH, UNSHARED Cell

and tools from the agent's identity, runs the Warden loop, and streams JobEvents
as they happen. It always tears the Cell and sidecar down, even on failure.
