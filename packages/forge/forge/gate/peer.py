"""Mark VI peer (§7, §9.2).

Connects to Mark VI's agents WebSocket as the agent it was launched as and speaks
the backend's existing protocol:

    → agent_register (agent_id, capabilities, model_preference, host/platform/roots)
    → heartbeat (periodic)
    → memory_request {skill: record_observation, ...}  → queued facts, flushed on connect
    ← task_dispatch {task_id, from, task, cwd}     → run one job → task_result
    ← chat_request  {chat_id, history, cwd, ...}   → run one job → chat_event stream
    ← chat_cancel   {chat_id}                       → abort that run (graceful)
    ← chat_steer    {chat_id, text}                 → inject text into that run
    ← owner_memory_sync {block}                     → refresh the local memory snapshot
    ← shutdown                                      → stop, no reconnect

The peer carries no identity of its own — `cfg` is whichever AgentConfig it was
started with, so the same class serves Optimus, Centurion, or a third agent
(§2). Graceful fallback is Mark VI's side of the contract (§9.2): when this peer
is offline, Mark VI answers with its in-process profile.
