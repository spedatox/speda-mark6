"""The live region — everything happening right now, on more than one row.

`spinner.py` owns one line and answers three questions: alive, how long, what is
it costing. That was enough while the loop did one thing at a time. It stopped
being enough once the loop grew concurrency it could not show:

    MAX_TOOL_CONCURRENCY = 10      (warden/engine.py)
    MAX_CONCURRENT       = 4       (warden/subagents.py)

A parallel batch rendered as `Running grep` while nine other calls were in
flight and invisible. Subagents were worse than invisible — `render.py` had no
`_on_subagent` handler at all, so a delegation that runs for minutes produced
literally nothing on screen. The harness knew; the operator could not see it.
That is the same failure shape as everything else in RESILIENCE.md, wearing a
different hat.

**Rich is the layout engine; the transient mechanics stay Forge's.** Rich
composes the rows — alignment, truncation, styling, width — which is the part
that is genuinely hard to hand-roll and the reason a hand-rolled TUI reads as
primitive. But it renders to *lines*, and those lines are drawn and erased with
`ansi.rewind`, the same primitive the streamed-prose repaint already uses.

That split is deliberate. `rich.Live` would want to own stdout, and stdout is
already shared with prompt_toolkit's `patch_stdout` and with every direct
`ansi.write` in the renderer. Two owners is a corruption bug waiting for a
parallel batch. Keeping the existing clear-before-write contract — which
`StreamRenderer` already honours on every event — means the region is
generalised from one row to N rows and nothing else changes.

**Never scrolls, and that is load-bearing.** Every frame is fully reclaimed
before the next is drawn. A region that leaks even one row per frame turns a
five-minute turn into a screenful of dead frames with the conversation buried
underneath. The rows are also capped: past `MAX_ROWS`, or past what the terminal
can hold, the region summarises rather than growing, because a rewind taller
than the screen eats scrollback that was never ours.

Degrades to `Spinner` exactly. Without Rich, without a tty, or with colour off,
this is the single line it always was.
