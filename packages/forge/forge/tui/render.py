"""Turning the engine's event stream into something a person can read.

The engine already emits everything the loop knows — chunk, tool, tool_result,
usage, compact, error. This subscribes to that same stream, which means the TUI
watches a job exactly the way Mark VI does over the socket. There is no second
path and no privileged access: if something is invisible here it is invisible to
Heartbreaker too, and that is a bug in the event vocabulary rather than in the
renderer.

The distinction the layout exists to preserve: what the model **said** is plain
text at the margin, and everything the harness **did** is indented and dim. A
transcript that blurs those reads like the model ran the commands itself.
