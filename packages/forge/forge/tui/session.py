"""One interactive session: state that outlives a turn, and how a turn renders.

The Warden runs one job and returns a Terminal. A conversation is many of those
sharing a transcript, a ledger, a Cell and a set of standing approvals — so the
session owns those and hands them to each turn, rather than a turn owning
anything.

The terminal oracle is the piece worth pointing at. It is the third
implementation of Seam 2 (after auto-deny and the peer socket), it took eleven
lines, and no core module knew it was coming. That is the whole claim the seam
was built to make.

**The scope lives in the label.** "always" told the operator nothing about what

the one answer nobody should agree to from a word they had to interpret.

**Refusing is not the end of the exchange.** A bare "no" tells the agent it may
not do this and nothing about what to do instead, so it guesses — and the most
