"""The rendering layer — Rich primitives, inline.

`ansi.py` writes escape sequences into strings and computes its own padding.
That is fine for a line and does not scale to a layout: every box, column and
wrap has to be measured by hand, and the measurement is wrong the moment a
string carries a style. The reference TUI does not do that — it has a layout
engine underneath (Ink), and the difference is most of why a hand-rolled
version reads as primitive next to it.

Rich is the equivalent here. Crucially it renders **inline**, the same as Ink:
output commits to the terminal's own scrollback, so scrolling, selection and
copy keep working and the transcript survives the session. A full-screen
framework would take the alternate buffer and lose all of that.

**Additive, never load-bearing.** `ansi` remains the primitive layer and every
function here degrades to it when Rich is absent. Forge installs with pydantic,
websockets and anthropic; the terminal getting nicer must not be the reason a
peer cannot start.

**Grey, not branded.** The palette is neutral by choice — one accent for
structure, colour reserved for meaning: green and red carry diffs and failures
because that is information, everything else is a shade.
