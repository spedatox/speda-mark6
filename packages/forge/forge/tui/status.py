"""The status line — model, context, spend, mode, branch, directory.

Claude Code keeps this pinned to the bottom of the screen because Ink owns a
dynamic region down there. An inline renderer has no such region: anything
pinned to the last row has to be redrawn on every scroll, which fights the
terminal's own scrollback instead of using it.

So this is drawn **above the prompt**, once per input. It scrolls away with
everything else, and it appears at exactly the moment its numbers are
actionable — when the operator is deciding what to type next. Pinning it would
show the same information continuously and be read at that same moment anyway.

    optimus · deepseek-v4-pro · 18% ctx · 12.4k in / 3.1k out · act · main · forgetest

Cost in real money is deliberately absent unless the operator supplies prices.
Token counts are measured; a dollar figure derived from a rate table baked into
this file would be a guess wearing a measurement's clothes, and it would go
stale silently the first time a provider changed a price. PRICES below is empty
on purpose — fill it in and the line starts showing money.
