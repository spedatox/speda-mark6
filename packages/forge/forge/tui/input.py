"""The input line — history, completion, modes, and the keys that drive them.

What was here before was `input()` on a worker thread. It read a line, and that
was the whole of it: no history, so a mistyped twenty-word prompt had to be
retyped; no completion, so every slash command had to be remembered exactly; no
way to write a second line; no way to run a quick `git status` without spending
a model turn on it.

Built on prompt_toolkit, which supplies the parts that are genuinely hard to get
right across terminals and operating systems — cursor handling, bracketed paste,
reverse search, and a Windows implementation that behaves. Optional: when it is
absent the REPL falls back to plain `input()` with every feature degraded but
nothing broken, the same contract the graph tool uses when Graphify is missing.

**Inline, never full-screen.** prompt_toolkit is used in its inline mode, so
completed turns commit to the terminal's own scrollback. Scroll, select and copy
keep working, output interleaves with shell history, and the transcript is still
on screen after the session ends. A full-screen app would take the alternate
buffer and lose all four — which is why this is not one, and why Claude Code's
own UI is not one either.

Three input modes, distinguished by the first character:

    › fix the retry logic      a prompt for the model
    ! git status               run it in the Cell, no model turn, no tokens
    / compact                  a REPL command
