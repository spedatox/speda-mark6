"""The input line.

What was here before was `input()` on a worker thread — no history, no
completion, no second line, and no way to run `git status` without spending a
model turn on it.

Most of what the new layer does needs a terminal, so what is tested here is the
part that does not: the mode rule, the completion sources, and the fallback.
Those are the pieces where a mistake is silent — a prefix rule that swallows an
ordinary sentence, or a completer that offers a command that no longer exists.
