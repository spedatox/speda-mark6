"""A tool nobody can be given is a tool that does not exist.

`hisar_list`, `hisar_read`, `hisar_deposit` and `telegram_send` were written,
documented, unit-tested, and filtered out when the deployment could not serve
them — and never once reached an agent, because the wiring that makes a group
NAMEABLE was never done. `_TOOL_GROUPS` had no `hisar` and no `notify`, so a
profile had no word for either, so neither profile asked for them.

Nothing failed. `_resolve_tools` rejects a group name it does not know, which
catches a profile asking for something that is not there. There was no check the
other way round — a group that exists and that nothing can ask for — and the two
look identical from inside the registry: a short tool list either way.

That is the shape this file exists to catch, because it is silent by
construction. A dead tool produces no error, no warning, and no failing test.
It produces an agent that quietly cannot do something, which nobody notices
until they go looking for why.
